abstract = {Objectives. Uncertainty in survival prediction beyond trial follow-up is highly influential in cost-effectiveness analyses of oncology products. This research provides an empirical evaluation of the accuracy of alternative methods and recommendations for their implementation. Methods. Mature (15-year) survival data were reconstructed from a published database study for “no treatment,” radiotherapy, surgery plus radiotherapy, and surgery in early stage non–small cell lung cancer in an elderly patient population. Censored data sets were created from these data to simulate immature trial data (for 1- to 10-year follow-up). A second data set with mature (9-year) survival data for no treatment was used to extrapolate the predictions from models fitted to the first data set. Six methodological approaches were used to fit models to the simulated data and extrapolate beyond trial follow-up. Model performance was evaluated by comparing the relative difference in mean survival estimates and the absolute error in the difference in mean survival v. the control with those from the original mature survival data set. Results. Model performance depended on the treatment comparison scenario. All models performed reasonably well when there was a small short-term treatment effect, with the Bayesian model coping better with shorter follow-up times. However, in other scenarios, the most flexible Bayesian model that could be estimated in practice appeared to fit the data less well than the models that used the external data separately. Where there was a large treatment effect (hazard ratio = 0.4), models that used external data separately performed best. Conclusions. Models that directly use mature external data can improve the accuracy of survival predictions. Recommendations on modeling strategies are made for different treatment benefit scenarios.},

abstract = {flexsurv is an R package for fully-parametric modeling of survival data. Any parametric time-to-event distribution may be fitted if the user supplies a probability density or hazard function, and ideally also their cumulative versions. Standard survival distributions are built in, including the three and four-parameter generalized gamma and F distributions. Any parameter of any distribution can be modeled as a linear or log-linear function of covariates. The package also includes the spline model of Royston and Parmar (2002), in which both baseline survival and covariate effects can be arbitrarily flexible parametric functions of time. The main model-fitting function, flexsurvreg, uses the familiar syntax of survreg from the standard survival package (Therneau 2016). Censoring or left-truncation are specified in 'Surv' objects. The models are fitted by maximizing the full log-likelihood, and estimates and confidence intervals for any function of the model parameters can be printed or plotted. flexsurv also provides functions for fitting and predicting from fully-parametric multi-state models, and connects with the mstate package (de Wreede, Fiocco, and Putter 2011). This article explains the methods and design principles of the package, giving several worked examples of its use.},

abstract = {Using parametric models, a procedure for projecting survival estimates beyond the follow-up limits of a clinical trial is developed. The methodology consists of fitting an appropriate parametric model to the tail of a survival curve and using the estimated model in conjunction with the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimate to produce a composite survival-function estimator. This estimator is especially useful whenever a parametric model is more easily fit to the tail rather than to the entire survival curve. Probability plots are used to evaluate different parametric models as well as to determine appropriate values for the cut points that define the survival-function tail. The bootstrap method provides estimates of variation in the projected survival curve. The resulting projected survival estimates allow one to make inferences on long-term treatment effects in clinical trials. As a motivating application, we project survival curves to estimate long-term treatment effects on quality-of-life-adjusted survival. This represents an extension of a statistical procedure called Q-TWiST (Quality-adjusted Time Without Symptoms of disease and Toxicity of treatment), which evaluates treatments in terms of both quantity and quality of life. In a standard Q-TWiST analysis, the average time spent in each of a number of health states, which differ in quality of life, is estimated from clinical trial data. The health states are weighted according to the quality of life experienced, and the results are combined to produce an estimate of quality-adjusted survival. Such estimates, however, are restricted to the follow-up limit of the data. The way in which the extrapolation methodology provides longer range estimates of Q-TWiST is described. To illustrate the techniques, we apply the methodology to data from the International Breast Cancer Study Group Trial V, which compares long-duration adjuvant chemotherapy versus short-duration chemotherapy in the treatment of node-positive breast cancer. Five-year median follow-up data are used to predict 10-year results in terms of mean survival and mean Q-TWiST. The results indicate that patients continue to benefit greatly from the long-duration chemotherapy between 5 and 10 years following treatment. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

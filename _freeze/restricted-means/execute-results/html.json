The method as used in the NICE TAs generally involved simply using all the available data to estimate the area under the Kaplan Meier curve up until the final observation, similar to an approach presented in the statistical literature by [@Moeschberger1985]. Generally, a restricted means approach has only been taken when trial data was relatively complete compared to situations where parametric modelling was used.\n\n\n$$\n\\mu_{\\tau} = \\mbox{E}[T \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\theta}]= \\int_0^{\\tau} S(t)dt.\n$$\n\n\n## Calculation in R\n\n`flexsurv` has some in-built functions to easily calculate RMST. The names of these functions are pre-pended with `rmst_` e.g. `rmst_exp()`.\n\nTo see this, let us calculate the RMST for an exponential distribution rate 1 and $t \\leq 0.5$.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(flexsurv)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nLoading required package: survival\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nt <- 0.5\n\nrmst_exp(t, rate = 1, start = 0)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.3934693\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nden <- curve(dexp, 0, 5)\n\npolygon(x = c(den$x[den$x <= t], t, 0),\n        y = c(den$y[den$x <= t], 0, 0),\n        col = \"slateblue1\",\n        border = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](restricted-means_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## As an alternative to hazard ratio\n\nThe `survRM2` package is specifically for comparing restricted means analyses.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(survRM2)\n\nD <- rmst2.sample.data()\n\ntime   <- D$time\nstatus <- D$status\narm    <- D$arm\n\nobj <- rmst2(time, status, arm, tau=10)\n\nplot(obj, xlab=\"Years\", ylab=\"Probability\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](restricted-means_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n[Royston2013]\n\nRoyston, P., Parmar, M.K.
